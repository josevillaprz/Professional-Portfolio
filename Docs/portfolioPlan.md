## Portfolio Research

### What Makes an Effective Portfolio?

- **Clean and simple:**   
Create a clean professional appearance that clearly explains your portfolio goal without being too overwhelming or hard to navigate to what theyre are interested in. A bad user experience can create frustration to the viewer and may hinder your success at being seeing.
  
- **An Effective About me page:**    
The about me page is the perfect opportunity to showcase skills you know and are confident in bringing to their team. This can include any programming languages, frameworks, design tools, and planning strategies. Having a well rounded set of skills lets recruiters and employers know what you bring to the company and to the teams.

- **Previous/Current Projects:**   
This portion of the portfolio may be the most important as it is what the person viewing your portfolio can determine what your skills look like in action. This is an opportunity for your target market to see what you can offer to them. 

- **Create it with what you know:**
One of the biggest showcases of your skill is how you create your portfolio. Creating a portfolio using the tools you list is a great opportunity to show the employer looking that you know what you are doing.


### Understanding the audience being targeted

- **Organization:**   
Bigger companies tend to be more well organized than a small company or startup. Work enviorment is has more structure and work is delegated in a more organized fashion. Tasks are usually assigned to dedicated teams and then to dedicated members based on skill. More organization also bring more structure to your work-life balance whereas smaller companies may require you to work long hours.

- **Bigger Teams:**   
Being part of a bigger team may provide more opportunites for mentorship and growth whereas smaller companies may not always have that as you may be in very small teams with less resources.
